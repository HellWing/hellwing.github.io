This page sketches the program, organized in three strands.

### Simulation campaigns {#simulation-campaigns}
- MG Millennium, COLAVERSE, ELEPHANT, gravity only and hydro runs spanning f(R), nDGP, WDM, neutrinos, dynamical dark energy.  
- Tools: MG COLA, ECOSMOG, SWIFT with MG in progress, MIMIC for constrained initial conditions.  
- Public components with documentation and sample data products.

### Novel statistics {#novel-statistics}
- Ellipsoidal counts in cells skewness in redshift space, anisotropic cumulants.  
- Pairwise velocity distributions as physical probes, environment stratified growth tests.

### Cosmic Web methodology {#cosmic-web}
- CACTUS: V web, T web, NEXUS+ with universal thresholds.  
- Dual scale labels, classifier uncertainty, and environment aware inference.
